# Dijkstra_in_Cities
In a graph prepared from the map of the country, the cities and the roads between them are shown. We want to find the farthest city by choosing a city of origin.  In calculating the distance between two cities, we consider the shortest route.
The first line contains three integers n and m
Q, which are the number of cities, the number of roads, and the number of origin cities, respectively.
Then in the next m line, three integers
u, v, and l are given so that two cities
u and v with a two-way road in length
L are connected.
After that, on the next Q line, the qis are given, each specifying a city of origin
